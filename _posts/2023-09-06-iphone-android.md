## Job Search

![alt text](../assets/images/jobs.jpg)

In last couple of years, I was actively applying for jobs in technology sector, and used different COTS products and this is my review of those products and why I prefer one over other

As it is looking for a new job is already a stresful venture and some of the products, companies use make it is not a very refreshing or welcoming sign for the potential candiates to apply.

####[Linkedin Easy Apply](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/product-update/recruiting-and-candidate-search-tool/lever/easy-apply)

Easily my favorite as it let me stay in linkedin and answer few questions and viola application is in.


####[Workday](https://www.workday.com/)

This is my least favorite for couple of reasons, every time you have to apply create an account or login to the account to fill out things, there are few companies I don't apply anymore because they use workday. Second reason with workday is to fill our profile you need to put down everything from resume in the workday ( positions you helf, education you got etc.) which I feel is cumbesome as text extract software from a PDF can do that job. 

####Other Products

These products are also easy to work with, applying doesn't take lot of effort and UI wise easy to deal with.
